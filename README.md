=============

Gedit plugin for quick project navigation

Performs quick search for project names present on given project folders.
Opens a new gedit window with filebrowser root set to chosen project's folder.
Perfect team with [grepint](https://github.com/rubencaro/gedit_grepint).
List of folders containing projects is given via plugin configuration dialog.

By now, a _project_ is no more than a folder with a _.git_ folder in it.

Once invoked you can directly edit the pattern,
or navigate through the hits list with up/down keys.
Go there pressing enter on selected result.
No mouse needed.

Uses __\<Ctrl\><Alt>P__ accelerator.

Roughly based on https://github.com/rubencaro/gedit_grepint
